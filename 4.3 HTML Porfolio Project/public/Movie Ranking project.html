<h1>The Best Movies According to Daniel</h1>

<h2>My top 3 Movies of all-time</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Chef</h3>
<p>This is my go-to movie when i need to clear my mind and stay positive, or you could say this is one of my best comfort movie</p>

<h3>The hitman's bodyguard</h3>
<p>One of my favourite action movie. Almost just because of the main cast in it namely: Samuel L. Jackson and Ryan Reynolds. I love action movies with a bit of comedy in it which is why this movie perfectly fits my criteria. Although i'll need to add that this movie is Rated R, so it's not for everyone since this movie uses a lot of profane language and explicit scenes.</p>

<h3>Ratatouille</h3>
<p>Arguably one of the best Disney movie that i have ever watched. Loved the colors and moral of the story which is more or less: "Anything is possible".</p>
